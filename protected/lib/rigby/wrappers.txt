Rigby provides a ton of wrapper classes that don't appear to do much if anything, why do they exist?

First off, the wrapper classes are not an attempt to take credit for the brilliant work Will Bond has done.
The wrappers exist for a couple of reasons.

1)  Naming Convention:
    Rigby Core uses a similar naming convention to prevent naming collision, it prepends every Rigby Core Class with a lowercase r.
    Without wrapper classes there would be a blend of rClasses and fClasses that would pose a barrier to anyone new to Rigby.
    
2)  Natural Extension Points:
    Rigby is intended to be an extension to the tremendous Flourish Library.  Although many wrappers do nothing, having the wrappers
    available provides a natural control point to add extensions in the future.
    
3)  Division of Components:
    By keeping Flourish and Rigby separate, Rigby can adopt the latest Flourish code in a modular fashion.  Keeping up to date with the
    latest Flourish developments is crucial to the success of the library.  The official releases will always be fully tested, but as a 
    Rigby user you are welcome to drop in the latest and greatest Flourish bleeding edge.
